Assignment: Agile Development Model

Project: AI-Driven Unified Data Platform (CMLRE - MoES)

---

## 1. Methodology Selection: The Scrum Framework

For this project, we are adopting the Scrum model, a subset of Agile. Given the complexity of integrating 
heterogeneous datasets (Oceanographic, Genomic, and Morphological), Scrum allows for iterative development, 
frequent testing, and the flexibility to adjust AI models based on data quality.

Core Scrum Components:

* Sprint Duration: 2 Weeks.
* Scrum Roles:
    Product Owner: Simulating the Ministry of Earth Sciences (CMLRE).
    Scrum Master: Managing the workflow and removing blockers.
    Dev Team: CSE students (Full-stack, AI/ML, and Database roles).


* Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Burn-down Charts.

## 2. Pictorial Representation (Conceptual)

1. Product Backlog (List of all features)
2. Sprint Planning (Selecting tasks for the next 14 days)
3. The Sprint (Development & Daily Stand-ups)
4. Sprint Review (Demo of a functional module)
5. Sprint Retrospective (Internal team improvement)

## 3. Detailed Sprint Roadmap (12-Week Plan)

Sprint 1- Infrastructure:
Cloud environment setup, DB schema for Geospatial & NoSQL data.

Sprint 2- Data Ingestion:
Module to upload CSV/Excel/JSON with Darwin Core metadata tagging.

Sprint 3- GIS Visualization:
Interactive Leaflet.js maps showing ocean parameters (Temp/Salinity).

Sprint 4- AI Bio-Module:
Integration of BLAST API for eDNA matching and Otolith CNN prototype.

Sprint 5- Cross-Analytics:
AI-driven correlation reports (e.g., Environment vs. Fish Abundance).

Sprint 6- Deployment:
Final API documentation (Swagger), RBAC security, and UI polishing.

## 4. User Story Backlog (Requirement Examples)

Agile requirements are defined by user stories to ensure the platform meets scientist needs:

* Story 1: As a Marine Researcher*, I want to upload an eDNA sequence so that I can automatically match it against 
  the GenBank database for species identification.
* Story 2: As a Data Analyst*, I want to overlay fish distribution maps with salinity data to identify high-yield 
  fishing zones.
* Story 3: As a CMLRE Admin*, I want to manage role-based access to ensure sensitive molecular data is only 
  accessible to authorized personnel.

## 5. Justification for Agile in this Project

* Handling Complexity: The AI models for taxonomic classification require multiple iterations of training and 
  validation; Agile supports this via incremental improvements.
* Stakeholder Feedback: Regular "Sprint Reviews" ensure that the platform alignment stays close to the Ministry’s 
  specific requirements for oceanographic data standards.
* Risk Mitigation: By delivering a "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) by Sprint 2 (the Ingestion Engine), we ensure that
  the core functionality is always operational.
