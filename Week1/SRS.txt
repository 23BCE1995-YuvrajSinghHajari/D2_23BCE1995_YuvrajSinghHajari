Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project: AI-Driven Unified Data Platform (PS ID: 25041)

1. Introduction
Purpose: To provide a unified digital backbone for CMLRE to integrate multidisciplinary marine data for sustainable 
resource management.

Scope: The system will handle data ingestion, AI-based taxonomic classification, eDNA sequence matching, and 3D 
visualization of fish morphology.

2. Overall Description
Product Perspective: A web-based platform integrated with cloud storage (AWS/Azure) and international marine data 
standards.

User Classes: * Marine Scientists: Data upload, cross-domain analysis, and visualization.

Policymakers: Accessing high-level biodiversity reports and trends.

Administrators: Managing metadata standards and user permissions.

3. Functional Requirements (FR)
FR1: Automated Data Ingestion: Must support CSV, Excel (structured), JSON/XML (semi-structured), and imagery/FASTA 
files (unstructured).

FR2: Metadata Tagging: Automatic standardization of data using Darwin Core (DwC) and OBIS formats.

FR3: AI Module (Taxonomy & Morphology): * Image-based identification of fish species using CNNs.

Automated morphometric measurement extraction from otolith images.

FR4: eDNA Integration: A module to store environmental DNA sequences and match them against global databases (like 
GenBank) via APIs.

FR5: Geospatial Visualization: An interactive GIS map showing fish distribution correlated with ocean parameters 
(Temp, Salinity, pH).

4. External Interface Requirements
User Interfaces: Dashboard-style UI with specific tabs for "Oceanography," "Genomics," and "Morphology."

Software Interfaces: Integration with Python-based ML libraries and PostGIS for mapping.

Communication Interfaces: RESTful APIs for data exchange with other MoES departments.

5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
Scalability: The backend must handle high-volume datasets (TB scale) without performance degradation.

Security: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to protect sensitive biodiversity and national resource data.

Interoperability: Ability to export data in formats compatible with international marine biological data portals.
